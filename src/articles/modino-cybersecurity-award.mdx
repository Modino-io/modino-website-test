## Addressing global problem with Polish know-how

Modino.io is a Polish startup established in 2021 in Olsztyn. Modino.io is a team of young Polish engineers backed up by senior cybersecurity experts whose goal is to create a platform that facilitates safe and reliable software updates on IoT devices of various types - from industrial devices to consumer goods. The problem we have identified is related to the fact that the number of IoT devices in the world is growing rapidly, but their quality in terms of security leaves much to be desired. Attacks on this type of devices are posing an increasing global challenge that we want to counteract.
